Still in progress but this is what I have so far!! I tried to challenge myself by making a game using only HTML if you can see

I wanted to get back into coding and making things but was tired of doing the same things over and over. So I decided to try something new and use a language I don't use often, HTML. This helped me learn more about its capabilities and its true purpose and function. I don't recomend doing this as HTML is really just the building blocks and other languages like js are really what making things fun. But overall I learned a lot and I want to see this through till the end. I hope you enjoy and dont rage quit too early.

The main purpose of this game is to really make you want to quit but at the end it'll all be worth it! You'll meet new characters along the way which the Ring Master will introduce. You'll also understand why he got that name! You'll see me pop in a few times whenever a part of it is incomplete and I'm still working on it! Hint: You'll really have to think outside the box for this one so try your best!!

Best enjoyed on a laptop/computer/pc or anything thats not a phone! 

Any and all feedback is appreciated!
